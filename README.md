# functional-blog-example

This project is organized is that there is a collection of notes and separately
a collection of pages. Each note is individual and independent, and represents a
single relatively self-contained piece of content. A page is just a collection
of notes with some structuring.

Importantly, each page has a `public_path`, which is the public path to the note
via URL.
